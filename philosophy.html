            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>I care about many things in philosophy, but the things I most often think about are meta-philosophy, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, formal logic, epistemology, ethics and politics.</p>
            <p>You'll notice that most of the things I care about are related to a deep tradition of empiriscism, which is no coincidence, since I am  quite a radical empiricist myself. I am also very fond of the pragmatist tradition, which significantly underlies most of my thinking; so much so that I call my meta-philosophical position "Pragmatic Fictionalism", and I hope to publish an essay outlining and defending it in the near future.</p>
