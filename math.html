            <h1>Research Interests</h1>

            <p>Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in Complex Geomtric Analysis, Pluripotential Theory, Several Complex Variables, and Complex Dynamics (Everything Complex!).</p>
            <p>More specifically, I care about Monge-Ampere type equations on Compact KÃ¤hler/Hermitian Manifolds, and their applications to geometric problems. I also care about problems involving Stein Manifolds and special domains of \(\mathbb{C}^{n}\).</p>
            <p>On the summer of 2023,I worked on an REU project with David Sieg, under the guidance of Dylan Thurston. We studied topological invariants of graphs generated by a family of rational maps (Post Critically Finite maps), and the relation of these invariants to the expansion of the Julia Sets of such maps.</p>
            <p>I am currently thinking about a problem posed by Wiegerinck in 1984. It envolves giving a characterization of domains in \(\mathbb{C}^{n}\) that have the following property: they  admit a Bergman space that is either trivial or infinite dimensional.  </p>
